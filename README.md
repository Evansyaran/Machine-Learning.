# Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree & Linear Regression
# Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of three fundamental supervised learning models:

    Logistic Regression (for classification tasks)
    Decision Tree (for classification and regression)
    Linear Regression (for predictive modeling)

The goal is to showcase how these models work, their use cases, and how they perform on real-world datasets.
# Project Features

âœ… Data preprocessing and feature engineering

âœ… Implementation of logistic regression, decision trees, and linear regression

âœ… Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE

âœ… Visualizations for insights

# Installation

Using Google Colab I installed all required libraries:
# Dataset Used

These project used a sample dataset for binary classification and regression tasks. The dataset includes independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target).
# Models Implemented
# 1. Logistic Regression (For Classification)

Used for binary classification problems where the target variable is 0 or 1.
# 2. Decision Tree Classifier (For Classification)

A non-linear model that learns from the data by splitting it into decision nodes.
 # 3. Linear Regression (For Regression)

Used when predicting continuous values like house prices or sales predictions.
 # Model Evaluation Metrics

    Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
        Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
    Regression Model (Linear Regression)
        Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), RÂ² Score
# Results & Observations

ðŸ“Œ Logistic Regression is effective for binary classification but assumes linear decision boundaries.
ðŸ“Œ Decision Trees can model non-linear relationships and are prone to overfitting.
ðŸ“Œ Linear Regression works well for continuous variables but assumes a linear relationship.
# Conclusion

These projects provided a hands-on guide for understanding and implementing classification and regression models in machine learning. Each model has its strengths and limitations, and selecting the right model depends on the dataset and problem type.
# Next Steps

ðŸ”¹ Try Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize model performance
ðŸ”¹ Implement Random Forest or XGBoost for better accuracy
ðŸ”¹ Use Cross-Validation for more reliable evaluation
